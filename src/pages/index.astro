        Thank you to everyone who came out to support the Austin Street Open Street event on Sunday, Sept 14th! We had a fantastic turnout and it was wonderful to see so many members of the community enjoying the street in a new way.
        But we aren't done. While a sliver of Austin Street was safer, better and more vibrant for a few hours, we need permanent changes! Stay tuned, but for now, enjoy this <a href="https://vimeo.com/1118604105">short video by Streetfilms</a> about Austin Day.
