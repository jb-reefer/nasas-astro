# SUPPORT THE AUSTIN STREET OPEN STREET!

After the success of [Austin Day](/news/hurray-for-austin-day/) and Trick or Streets last year, we are, once again, advocating for an Open Street on Austin Street!
This year we are aiming for four (4) Sundays in August and September. Support this intiative by signing our petition below!
