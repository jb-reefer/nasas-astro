We had our first field event on Saturday! Thank you all who came out and helped us map Austin Street pedestrian access.

Before we get into the results, some terminology is important to understand.

## Anatomy of a sidewalk

Three zones comprise a sidewalk: the walk lane, the clear path, and the furnishing zone.

### Walk Lane

The portion of the sidewalk that accommodates pedestrian movement. This includes a clear path and can also include other amenities. An example of this would be a sign advertising a business. Such a sign can only be close to the building and cannot cross into the Clear Path.

### Clear Path

The portion of the walk lane that is free from amenities for uninterrupted pedestrian flow.

### Furnishing Zone

The section of the sidewalk between the curb and walk lane that does not accommodate pedestrian movement. Amenities, such as lighting, benches, tree beds, utility poles, or bicycle parking, can be placed in this section.
