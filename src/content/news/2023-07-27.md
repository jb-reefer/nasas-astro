Join N.A.S.A.S on August 12th @ 10am for an opportunity to do some crowdsourced surveying. This event will provide participants with first hand knowledge of the existing dimensions of pedestrian infrastructure on Austin Street.

We will be using a free surveying service, [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/atlases/21l5zf17), to make annotations to Austin Street and surrounding streets. We’ll be using instruments like measuring wheels and tape to estimate the total width of the sidewalks and marked crossings.

We’ll also note where other important street infrastructure exists, such as street trees, benches, curb cuts and tactile markers for people with disabilities.

Data collected will be uploaded onto [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap), the world’s largest crowdsourced map and shared with the local community board.

Event is open to all age groups. Participants under 18 years old must be accompanied by an adult.

Event is weather permitting. Will reschedule to a later time in the event of inclement weather

Estimated event duration: 2 hours

Meet at at the [71st Avenue / Queens Boulevard station on the south side](https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B043'16.6%22N+73%C2%B050'38.9%22W/@40.721268,-73.8447677,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d40.721268!4d-73.844124?entry=ttu) by the 71st Avenue subway entrance
