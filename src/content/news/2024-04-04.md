We’re hearing that the city plans to continue its safety study on Austin Street this year. To help guide this process and ensure the community is heard, Neighbors for A Safer Austin Street is planning on hosting a set of workshops in 2024.

This will be an in-person workshop where the community can hash out a safer, better, and more equitable future for Austin Street. Location, date, and time are still being worked out, but if you’re interested, please fill out our survey here:
