Austin Street has long been a vibrant and diverse commercial hub in the heart of Forest Hills. Lined with a multitude of shops, restaurants, and small businesses, it is a beloved destination for both residents and visitors alike. However, despite its many attractions, Austin Street has faced ongoing challenges regarding pedestrian safety and comfort. For this reason, Neighbors for A Safer Austin Street started a campaign to solve these issues. As part of that campaign, [we have started a petition for business](https://forms.gle/kVNSeYYHsyCq6Bez8) owners and managers to fill out.

This article will delve into the importance of creating a safer Austin Street, not just for the well-being of residents and visitors but also for the prosperity of its businesses.

### The Current Situation

_A common sight on Austin Street: gridlock_

For years, Austin Street has grappled with various safety concerns. Over 90 traffic injuries have occurred since 2018; the street is known for its gridlocks and [narrow sidewalks](https://asaferaustinstreet.com/news/mapping-access-on-austin-st). The Q23, which services the street, has been called the ["The Slowest Bus in Queens."](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/nyregion/q23-slow-bus-queens.html) These issues have negatively impacted the street's business ecosystem, causing potential customers to rethink their shopping and dining experiences. Addressing these safety and comfort concerns is vital to ensure Austin Street remains a thriving commercial center.

### The Impact on Businesses

#### Customer Attraction and Retention:

_Restaurant Row, on 70th Rd, became an Open Street early in the pandemic, to great success. Sadly, many of the outdoor structures have now been removed._

[A safer, cleaner, and calmer environment attracts more people.](https://www.bbva.ch/en/news/investing-in-pedestrian-zones-increases-local-income/) A safer Austin Street would bring in more customers and encourage repeat visits, boosting the bottom line for local businesses.

#### Improved Accessibility:

_The narrow sidewalks make any additional obstruction, such as sidewalk sheds, worse._

Austin Street's sidewalks are narrow and often crowded. The lack of space is detrimental to all shoppers, but it is tough for the ones who need more space to move around, such as the elderly, wheelchair users, and caregivers with strollers; these are well-represented groups in our neighborhood. [City data](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/streets-for-recovery.pdf) shows that corridors with Open Streets bounced back faster from the pandemic than those without—and they continue to thrive. This shows the importance of people-first spaces to businesses.

A safer Austin Street, with wider sidewalks and more pedestrian space, would ensure visitors can easily access the stores, resulting in higher foot traffic, higher sales, and a more enjoyable shopping experience.

#### The Q23: The Slowest Bus in Queens

_An elderly woman with a walking cane is forced to get off the bus on the street due to a car blocking the bus stop. This is a common sight on Austin Street._

A redesign of Austin Street to eliminate congestion would also speed up the Q23 bus, making it easier and faster for shoppers and workers to access Austin Street. The congestion also leads to bus stops being chronically blocked. This not only sours the shopping experience of shoppers, but it can also be dangerous as wheelchair users are forced to offload on the street instead of the curb.

#### Positive Business Reputation:

_The Austin Street Fair. Twice a year, the whole street is dedicated to people. However, local businesses end up competing with Clearview Festival merchants. A redesign of Austin St would bring some of the benefits of the Fair every day, without the extra competition._

The congestion on Austin Street often leads to drivers honking. This has been shown to cause [hearing damage](https://hearing.health.mil/Prevention/Preventing-Noise-Induced-Hearing-Loss/How-Loud-is-Too-Loud) and [other health issues](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/clean-air-act-title-iv-noise-pollution), as well as leading to an unpleasant experience. [We have heard from residents that some avoid trying](https://patch.com/new-york/foresthills/fix-austin-street-re-leslie-brown-cb6-april-meeting-nodx?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=web&utm_source=share-link) to go to Austin Street if they can help it or use Queens Blvd to move up and down it instead of through it. This decreases the visibility of businesses, especially small ones, which rely so much on foot traffic.

[A street known to be pleasant fosters a positive business reputation.](https://www.bbva.ch/en/news/investing-in-pedestrian-zones-increases-local-income/) Customers are likelier to linger and explore shops and restaurants if the street is pleasant and calm. This reputation can increase word-of-mouth recommendations, leading to more shoppers visiting Austin Street.

#### An Opportunity to Fix Chronic Issues:

_A constant issue on Austin Street: pooled water. When mixed with garbage, it creates unsanitary, smelly conditions. These conditions can keep customers away._

Two issues that have plagued Austin Street for quite some time are garbage management and flooding. A Safer Austin Street can bring capital money from the City to finally resolve these issues by creating better garbage management, fixing the pooling of dirty water by repaving the street, and installing flood prevention measures such as bioswales. These issues will not only improve the look and feel of Austin Street but also save businesses.

### Conclusion

A Safer Austin Street is not only a matter of public safety but also a crucial factor in the success and prosperity of our local businesses. By addressing safety and comfort concerns, Austin Street can create an environment that attracts more customers, fosters positive business reputations, and drives economic development. The support and collaboration of businesses, residents, and officials are essential in making Austin Street a safer, better, more vibrant, more equitable, and thriving community for all.
