NYC DOT collecting community feedback at Queens Blvd and 71st Ave (south side)

The New York City Department of Transportation has started to collect feedback from pedestrians on Austin Street! This is for the study we’ve been advocating for!

They will be talking to people and asking them to complete a survey around the Austin Street area. Their hours will be 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., but the location and days are hidden, so look for them and tell them you want A Safer Austin Street!

And if you see them, let us know at info@ASaferAustinStreet.com.

This is a **significant** milestone for our efforts! Thank you all who have helped get us here!

But the fight isn’t over. DOT may have started to collect feedback, but we won’t stop fighting until we get a Safer, Better, More Environmentally Friendly, and more Economically Vibrant Austin Street!
